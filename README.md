# GitHelpNOW

AS a Person in need
I WANT to search for shelter locations near me
SO THAT I can find a place to safely spend the night.

Acceptance: 

GIVEN a map with a search bar and checkboxes for the following categories: shelter, food, women's shelter, health,
WHEN I insert my ZIP CODE and select one or more categories,
THEN I am presented with a map of my location.
When I view the map,
THEN I am presented with pin points of the locations I had selected.
