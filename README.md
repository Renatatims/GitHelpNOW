# GitHelpNOW

This project seeks to help those in need find access to help, support, and more, all that is local to their area. It uses multiple APIs to access nonprofit organizations in any given area, while also providing donation options for those who would like to support said non-profits. It is complete with a map that will pinpoint the locations of whatever type of non-profit is searched for such as a shelter, food bank, etc.
